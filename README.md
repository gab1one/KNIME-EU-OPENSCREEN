# KNIME-EU-OPENSCREEN
Provides KNIME nodes with functionality for data mining and screening data processing

FastTanimoto:  permits to search similar molecules within a set of molecules using molecular fingerprints. Output is presented such
that it can easily be incorporated into a report.

SPARQL Query: permits to send a SPARQL Query to a SPARQL endpoint and retrieves the result as a table of strings.

For quick installation of the nodes into an exsisting KNIME installation, download the "de.EUOPENSCREEN_1.0.0.201504071631.jar" file
and place it into the "dropins" subfolder of your knime installation. A new Category EU-OPENSCREEN will show up under
"uncategorized" containing the two plugins.
